### 🔐 End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)

> Messages are encrypted before they leave the client and decrypted only by the recipient.

- Each conversation uses a **unique symmetric key**  
- The conversation key is **encrypted with each user's public key**  
- Messages are encrypted using **XChaCha20-Poly1305**  
- The conversation key is **decrypted on the client only** using the user's private key  
- User’s private key is **encrypted with their password** using **Argon2id**  
- All decrypted keys are securely stored in **IndexedDB**  
- **Zero-knowledge design** — even the server can’t decrypt your data  

✅ Ensures **complete privacy and forward secrecy** in one-to-one conversations.

> **Note:** Video/audio streams use WebRTC's built-in SRTP encryption (DTLS-SRTP) which is secure by default.
